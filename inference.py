  # 2) Specify video relative location to the rink

  # 3) Run inference on those frames - save result in COCO format to data/annoations/inference.json
  
  # 4) Use data/annoations/inference.json to predict locations for each of the bboxes for each of the frames

  # 5) Use those predicted lcoations to identify where each person is on the rink - make a picture for each frame 

  # 6) Turn all those frames into a movie
